    <p>My name is violet and im objectively the worst "coder" you'll ever meet!</p>
    <br><br><br>
    <p>If you are so, so lonely as to make it here then i can assume that you're single, which is quite comical because I am not :3</p>

    <p>the more space I attempt to fill the more i understand how uninteresting, boring, and sad I am.</p>
