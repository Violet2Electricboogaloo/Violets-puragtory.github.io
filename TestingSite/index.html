            <h1>About Me:</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Violet. I'm a 13yo programmer who is too ambitious for my own good.
                I plan on becoming a game developer in the near future, but for now all I really have to show
                is some really, really mediocre JQuery/Javascript, CSS, and HTML. :3
                
                <br><br>

                I spend most of my time playing shitty games and doing other things that a child would do because I am
                one. I'm a very sensitive nutcase and constructive criticism is my second biggest fear! (If you have any
                reccomendations for this section please contact me I think its kinda underdeveloped.)

                <br><br>

                I hope that my website doesn't suck, and if you encounter anything particularly note worthy or just have
                some nice
                tips/advice or want me to change something, you can always find me on Github OR go to "My Socials" above
                for other
                platforms I reside on. (I am most active on Discord and Matrix)

                    <h1>General:</h1>
                    <p>Risk of rain 2 is best described as shoot enemy get money buy chest get item shoot more enemy etc... The game progressively gets more insane as you collect more items. You have to remember to watch the clock though, because for every second you spend on a stage, the difficulty increases. You can get to stage 6, and kill the final boss, you can get to stage 8, and obliterate, you can fight the new secret DLC boss by going to the void fields <em>or</em> get the portal by chance <em>or</em> use it after the final boss. If you want to though, you may also keep looping, going back to stage 1 again, except keeping all of your items, keep the difficulty, and keep the stage count. <br>The game has a legendary sound track by "Chris Christodoulou" that fits the game very well with its almost "alien" style. (I have 800 hours in this game please buy it!)</p>
                    <p>Plus, the modding community is thriving and most of the mods are fantastic! (Major credit towards the StarStorm 2 team!</p>
                    <h1 style="color: limegreen;">The Good:</h1>
                    <p style="color: rgb(128, 255, 128);">The game almost never restricts the player, leading to insane runs. <br> The game has an amazing cartoony-blend for its visual style <br> The game always has new, cool ideas and every update is something special.</p>
                    <h1 style="color: red;">The bad:</h1>
                    <p style="color: pink;">The game often inconviniences the player for certain stupid reasons. For example, the character "Captain" is unable to use certain moves in certain areas because it doesnt "line up with the lore" (which is really stupid please stop making your games worse for "story reasons" <br> The game locks lots of items and skills behind achievements, which can often be annoying and pointless.</p>
                    <h1 style="color: brown;">The Ugly:</h1>
                    <p>The game has some serious optimization issues. The game will often lag and stutter on later stages. The title screen for me and many people I know tends to use an extremely unnessacary amount of GPU. Furthermore for those using less powerful CPUs, the options tend to not have any notable effects.</p>
